## Prerequisites

You will need an AWS account with programatic access keys configured on your system. These keys will need to have access to Amazon Bedrock. Additionally, you will need to enable model access for all of the LLMs you wish to use in Amazon Bedrock's Model Access page. Here is a summary of steps to get things set up correctly.

### Creating an AWS Account

If you don't already have an AWS Account, you will need to create one. Simply go [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) and follow the steps to create an AWS Account from scratch. Please note, you will need to provide a valid credit card number, and there are fees associated with using LLMs with Amazon Bedrock, [outlined here](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/).
